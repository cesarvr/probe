### Probe

Is a simple [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) middleware to measure latency in your endpoints.

#### Usage

```js
//Make sure is first in the middleware stack. 
if(process.env.DEBUG){
  var probe = require('probe-mon');
  app.use(probe());
}
```

#### Data

This middleware return the following data:
  - **Event**: Is the IO event for now just trigger when the event finish is triggered.
  - **URL**: The endpoint URL, that was hit.
  - **Execution**: The time elapse between the arriving of the request to response.



In this output example I just have two endpoint one called /slow with a random delay, the delay at server side is returned to test the accuracy of the measurement and other endpoint called /fast that just respond immediately.

```sh
sloooowww 948     #server returned the delay random number 948ms.

event:  finish url:  /slow execution  964 ms
#this line is from the probe plugin
#execution measurement â‰ˆ16m deviation.

fast
event:  finish url:  /fast execution  2 ms

sloooowww 4697
event:  finish url:  /slow execution  4699 ms

fast
event:  finish url:  /fast execution  0 ms

sloooowww 2702
event:  finish url:  /slow execution  2705 ms

fast
event:  finish url:  /fast execution  0 ms

sloooowww 4701
event:  finish url:  /slow execution  4704 ms

fast
event:  finish url:  /fast execution  0 ms

sloooowww 2968
event:  finish url:  /slow execution  2972 ms

event:  finish url:  /fast execution  1 ms
fast
```
